                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Traditional integrated development environments (IDEs) provide developers with robust environments for writing, testing, debugging, and deploying code. As the world becomes increasingly networked and more services are delivered via the cloud, it is only natural that the functionality of IDEs be delivered via the cloud. In addition to simplifying the provisioning and deployment of new IDE features, and making it easier to integrate with other web native tools, cloud based IDEs provide some fundamental advantages when it comes to understanding the behavior of a wide community of software developers. One of these advantages for the IDE provider is the ability to transparently monitor and analyze the real-time fine-grained actions of a large number of developers.</p>

                <p>These transparent monitoring capabilities of cloud based IDEs todevelop advanced analytics to understand developers' behavior and infer their characteristics, which can be applied to improve the current user experience design.

                <h3>Method</h3>

                <p>The main method we applied is controlled laboratory user study. In the user study, subjects (Software Engineer and Researchers in IBM Research) were asked to perform programming samll programming tasks using JazzHub (a cloud based IDE developed by IBM). MITMPROXY and IBM Tealeaf was used to monitor users' interactions. We collected several different types of data:</p>

                <ol>
                <li>Internet traffics generated in using JazzHub;</li>
                <li>Video of screen histories;</li>
                <li>Audio in the user study sessions;</li>
                <li>Internet traffics generated in using JazzHub;</li>
                <li>Usability and User Experience questionnaire surveys;</li>
                <li>Interview.</li>
                </ol>                
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>We applied both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze collected data. For example, the Internet traffics were modelled as time-series data, and analyzed with co-integration techniques. We also used qualitative coding techniques to analyze video/audio data, interview transcripts, etc.
                </p>               
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>The user study lead to rich set of findings which are reported in our two papers and a report to JazzHub team for UX improvements. Some findings are as follows:
                <ol>
                <li>By analyzing the user activity traces, we can identify some of difficulties they experienced in using JazzHub;</li>
                <li>Simple improvements (e.g., position of output canvas) will greatly enhance user experience;</li>
                <li>Developer's expertise can be inferred from their interaction with JazzHub, which may help to develop recommandation system to provide their some help.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>However, I cannot provide the report to JazzHub team for confidential consideration. But I would like to talk more if you are interest. We also set up a basic A/B testing to inspect the alternative design with Google Analytics.</p>
